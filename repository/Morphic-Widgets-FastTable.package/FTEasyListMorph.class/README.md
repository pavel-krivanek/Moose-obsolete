I'm an easy list used to simplify the creation of lists.
My parent is too powerful, I'm just a simplification of it (and no, I will not go to the psy to deal with that).

 Example: 
=========
FTEasyListMorph new
	extent: 300@550;
	elements: Morph methods;
	display: [ :method | method selector ];		
	openInWindow.
