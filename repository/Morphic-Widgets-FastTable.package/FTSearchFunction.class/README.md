I define a search function for a table. 
I respond to any alphanumeric element and I add a search box to the  owner table. 

I use FTDataSource>>#searchTable:text: as input for my searchs. 

In general, my entry point is through #keyStroke:, because I intend to react to keyboard inputs in the owner table.
