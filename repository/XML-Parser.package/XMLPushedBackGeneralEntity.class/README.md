An abstract class to wrap pushed-back general entities to keep track of the nesting of elements within entity replacements.

Each time a start tag is parsed from the entity's replacement, the count is incremented, and each time an end tag is parsed, it's decremented. If it goes negative, then an end tag terminated an element not started by the entity. When the entity is popped, the count should be zero.
