This is meant to be used for inspecting objects. It offers multiple views and it uses a finder as a navigation. One particular feature is that you can use the evaluator tab to enter code, and evaluating it results in opening another pane to the right.

The object finder asks dynamically the object for the actual presentations that are displayed in each pane.

Example:
self openOn: Smalltalk.

Register it as a replacement for explorer:
self registerToolsOn: Smalltalk tools.
