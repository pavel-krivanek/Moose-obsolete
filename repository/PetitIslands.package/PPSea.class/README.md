A PPIsland allows for imprecise parsing. One can create it on a parser p by calling: 'p island' E.g.:

p := x, a island, y              accepts following inputs:
x.....a.....b 
xab

yet fails on:
x....a....c
xb
xac
x..b....a....b

The input represented by dots is called water and water can appear before and after the island. Use it, if you don't want to define all the grammar rules and you want to skip something.

I am still an experiment, but if you know how to improve me, please contact Jan Kurs at: kurs@iam.unibe.ch
