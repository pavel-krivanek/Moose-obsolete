I'm a fast table presentation who introduces FTTableMorph into Glamour  as a Tree that can have columns. 

Description
--------------------

IÂ know how to render myself and I store some options for the building a tree and for displaying multiple columns .  

I work with GLMMorphicFastTreeWithColumnsRenderer to render the FastTable. I use TGLMScriptingAPITablePresentation in order to adding the API for configuring columns.
