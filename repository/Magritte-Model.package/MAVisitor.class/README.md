I am a visitor responsible for visiting Magritte descriptions. I am an abstract class providing a default implementation for concrete visitors. The protocol I implement reflects the hierarchy of *MADescription* and its subclasses. Visiting a class which my subclasses don't implement specifically automatically defaults to a less-specific implementation. The code was automatically created using code on my class-side.
