I implement validation of internal boolean properties of particular object. I am returned from property should expression
	
	(1 @ 2) which x should be

And then for any message I perform validation. Only different from my superclass is that I wil push original property information to validation process. It make description of failure more informative.
	
	(1 @ 2) which x should be even
	 (1 @ 2) which x should not be even
