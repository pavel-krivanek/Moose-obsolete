This is a specialized inspector that is embedded in  GTDebugger.

It is special in two ways:
- the first presentation is different in that it shows all variables active in the debugging context
- the looking up of presentation ignores the default state presentation because the vertical splitting of state and workspace does not work in the context of the debugger due to space limitations. Instead, the workspace is offered in a separate presentation.
