Actions are elements of behavior that are executed upon a keyboard shortcut or other event.

Instances of Action are stored and maintained by Presentations. The exact representation is determined by the renderer, but actions can define a keyboard shortcut that should trigger the action or a title, category and position to be able to use the action as a context menu item.
