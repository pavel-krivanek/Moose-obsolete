A GLMRubEditingAreaBrick is basic text editor brick used for multi line input fields. 

vShrinkWrap - height fits text size + vertical paddings
hShrinkWrap - doesn't make any sense.
vSpaceFill - fills parent vertically. Actual text editor height = parent height - vertical paddings
hSpaceFill - doesn't really makes sense, since text area still shrinks to fit text
