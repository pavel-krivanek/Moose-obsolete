This is an abstract class for all loggers that need to serialize objects. Basically there are two types of loggers: one that stores signals in memory and this which exports signal to the outer world. In order to do that objects need to be serialized in some way.

In order to create a new serializing logger subclasses should overwrite two methods. On the class side overwrite #defaultSerializer to select the SignalSerializer that converst an object to an external representation. Second overwrite #nextPutSerialized:: to transmit the object to the outside world
