I am a Trait that manage some Glamour Model related functionalities. 

Description 
--------------------

I contains some functionnalities used by all the Glamour related data sources like the annoucements. Since a dataSource can be a list, or a outline list, or a tree â€¦ They cannot inherit from the same class. I am here to avoid a duplication of code.
