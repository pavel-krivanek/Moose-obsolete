I represent the concept of an example.

I am constructed out of a method that returns an object. I hold the meta-information about that method and I know how to construct the concrete resulting object that is returned by the method. 

I can depend on other examples, and other examples can depend on me. When I depend on another example, the code that produces me uses the result of the other example to construct me.

The class for which I represent the example is called my subject.

The class that offers the method out of which I am constructed is the provider.

I also know how to handle possible exceptions, which makes me a great candidate for encoding assumptions that are otherwise expressed as classic tests.
