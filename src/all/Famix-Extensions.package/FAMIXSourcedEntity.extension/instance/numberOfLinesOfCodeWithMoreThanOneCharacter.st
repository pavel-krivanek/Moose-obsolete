numberOfLinesOfCodeWithMoreThanOneCharacter
	<MSEProperty: #numberOfLinesOfCodeWithMoreThanOneCharacter type: #Number> <derived>
	<MSEComment: 'This metric is essentially similar to the numberOfLinesOfCode one, 
	the difference being that it only counts the lines with more than one non-whitespace characters.
	This metric is particularly useful for comparing the density of other metrics on a line of code.
	For example, depending on the formatting style chosen a Java curly brace, or a Smalltalk block 
	can appear inline or on a separate line. For normalization purposes, these commonly appearing 
	cases can be ruled out through the present metric.'>
