I provide the ability to browse composite parsers.

One can select a parser from a list and see all of the production rules of the grammar.

When a production rule is selected, on can test it by inputting a sample and clicking a "play" button to get results.

I also allow one to see the source of a production rule, see the graph or rules, a map of the ruleset, create examples of tokens for matching a given rule, see first and follow.

Based on the parsing of the content provided, there is some support for debugging.
