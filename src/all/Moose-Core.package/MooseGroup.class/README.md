MooseGroup adds on top of an abstract group the ability to change the type of a group when we change the entities inside. This is determined via class names.

For example, a XYZGroup handles a group of XYZ entities. Thus, "MooseGroup with: XYZ new" will return a XYZGroup. The type changing behavior also works at runtime. Thus, "MooseGroup new add: XYZ" will also return a XYZGroup.

The goal of this abstraction is to provide a home for behavior that is specific to groups of entities. For example, a visualization that makes sense for a group of XYZ entities will become a method in the XYZGroup class.
