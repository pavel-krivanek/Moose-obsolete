An abstract class for dynamically choosing a supported concrete implementation from a class hierarchy for this platform.

Each root subclass needs to override #preferredImplementation to return the preferred subclass and #noSupportedImplementationFound to signal an error if none are supported, and then each subclass of the root needs to define #isSupportedImplementation to return true if it supports this platform.
