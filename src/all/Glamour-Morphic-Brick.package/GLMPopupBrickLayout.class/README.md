I am a popup layout.
My main responsibility is to position popup's elements and align them.

Popup layout can be:
- downward (trigger brick is on top following by content below, default)
- upward (trigger brick is beneath the content)

Additionally, popup can be aligned differently
- left-to-right (trigger and content are aligned to the right within bounding box, default)
- right-to-left (trigger and content are aligned to the left within bounding box)
