A Variable is a ConnectableElement that may store values during the execution of an Activity. Reading and writing the values of a Variable provides an alternative means for passing data than the use of ObjectFlows. A Variable may be owned directly by an Activity, in which case it is accessible from anywhere within that activity, or it may be owned by a StructuredActivityNode, in which case it is only accessible within that node.
