A package can have one or more profile applications to indicate which profiles have been applied. Because a profile is a package, it is possible to apply a profile not only to packages, but also to profiles.
Package specializes TemplateableElement and PackageableElement specializes ParameterableElement to specify that a package can be used as a template and a PackageableElement as a template parameter.
A package is used to group elements, and provides a namespace for the grouped elements.
