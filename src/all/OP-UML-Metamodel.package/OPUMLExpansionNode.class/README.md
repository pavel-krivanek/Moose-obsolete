An ExpansionNode is an ObjectNode used to indicate a collection input or output for an ExpansionRegion. A collection input of an ExpansionRegion contains a collection that is broken into its individual elements inside the region, whose content is executed once per element. A collection output of an ExpansionRegion combines individual elements produced by the execution of the region into a collection for use outside the region.
