LinkEndData is an Element that identifies on end of a link to be read or written by a LinkAction. As a link (that is not a link object) cannot be passed as a runtime value to or from an Action, it is instead identified by its end objects and qualifier values, if any. A LinkEndData instance provides these values for a single Association end.
