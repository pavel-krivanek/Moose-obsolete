If isConjugated is false, provided is derived as the union of the sets of Interfaces realized by the type of the port and its supertypes, or directly from the type of the Port if the Port is typed by an Interface. If isConjugated is true, it is derived as the union of the sets of Interfaces used by the type of the Port and its supertypes."
