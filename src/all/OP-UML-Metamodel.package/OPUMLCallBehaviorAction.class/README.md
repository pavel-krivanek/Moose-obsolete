A CallBehaviorAction is a CallAction that invokes a Behavior directly. The argument values of the CallBehaviorAction are passed on the input Parameters of the invoked Behavior. If the call is synchronous, the execution of the CallBehaviorAction waits until the execution of the invoked Behavior completes and the values of output Parameters of the Behavior are placed on the result OutputPins. If the call is asynchronous, the CallBehaviorAction completes immediately and no results values can be provided.
