An InstanceSpecification is a model element that represents an instance in a modeled system. An InstanceSpecification can act as a DeploymentTarget in a Deployment relationship, in the case that it represents an instance of a Node. It can also act as a DeployedArtifact, if it represents an instance of an Artifact.
