A Transition represents an arc between exactly one source Vertex and exactly one Target vertex (the source and targets may be the same Vertex). It may form part of a compound transition, which takes the StateMachine from one steady State configuration to another, representing the full response of the StateMachine to an occurrence of an Event that triggered it.
