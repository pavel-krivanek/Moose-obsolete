	"Implies that the Transition, if triggered, occurs without exiting or entering the source State (i.e., it does not cause a state change). This means that the entry or exit condition of the source State will not be invoked. An internal Transition can be taken even if the SateMachine is in one or more Regions nested within the associated State."
