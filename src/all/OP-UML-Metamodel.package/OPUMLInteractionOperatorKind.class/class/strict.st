	"The InteractionOperatorKind strict designates that the CombinedFragment represents a strict sequencing between the behaviors of the operands. The semantics of strict sequencing defines a strict ordering of the operands on the first level within the CombinedFragment with interactionOperator strict. Therefore OccurrenceSpecifications within contained CombinedFragment will not directly be compared with other OccurrenceSpecifications of the enclosing CombinedFragment."
