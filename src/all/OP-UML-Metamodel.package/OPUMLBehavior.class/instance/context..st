context: aBehavioredClassifier
	"The BehavioredClassifier that is the context for the execution of the Behavior. A Behavior that is directly owned as a nestedClassifier does not have a context. Otherwise, to determine the context of a Behavior, find the first BehavioredClassifier reached by following the chain of owner relationships from the Behavior, if any. If there is such a BehavioredClassifier, then it is the context, unless it is itself a Behavior with a non-empty context, in which case that is also the context for the original Behavior. For example, following this algorithm, the context of an entry Behavior in a StateMachine is the BehavioredClassifier that owns the StateMachine. The features of the context BehavioredClassifier as well as the Elements visible to the context Classifier are visible to the Behavior."
