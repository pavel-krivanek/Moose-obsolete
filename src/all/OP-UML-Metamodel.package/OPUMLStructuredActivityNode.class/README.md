A StructuredActivityNode is an Action that is also an ActivityGroup and whose behavior is specified by the ActivityNodes and ActivityEdges it so contains. Unlike other kinds of ActivityGroup, a StructuredActivityNode owns the ActivityNodes and ActivityEdges it contains, and so a node or edge can only be directly contained in one StructuredActivityNode, though StructuredActivityNodes may be nested.
