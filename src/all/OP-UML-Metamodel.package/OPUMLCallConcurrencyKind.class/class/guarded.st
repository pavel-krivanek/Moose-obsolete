	"Multiple invocations of a BehavioralFeature that overlap in time may occur to one instance, but only one is allowed to commence. The others are blocked until the performance of the currently executing BehavioralFeature is complete. It is the responsibility of the system designer to ensure that deadlocks do not occur due to simultaneous blocking."
