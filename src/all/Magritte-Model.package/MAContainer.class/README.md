I am a container holding a collection of descriptions, all instances of subclasses of *MAElementDescription*. I keep my children within an ==OrderedCollection==, but I don't sort them according to their priority.

I fully support the collection protocol: descriptions can be added and removed. Moreover I implement most enumeration methods, so that users are able to iterate (==do:==), filter (==select:==, ==reject:==), transform (==collect:==), extract (==detect:==, ==detect:ifNone:==), and test (==allSatisfy:==, ==anySatisfy:==, ==noneSatisfy:==) my elements.
