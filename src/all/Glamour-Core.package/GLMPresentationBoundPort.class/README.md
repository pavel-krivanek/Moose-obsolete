This is a fancy port that enables us to access the value of a port from outside of a browser. It is bound to a presentation in the sense that it asks the presentation dynamically for the pane. In this way, when a presentation is placed (or copied) in another pane, the value will be dynamically looked up.

Instance Variables:
	presentation	<GLMPresentation>
