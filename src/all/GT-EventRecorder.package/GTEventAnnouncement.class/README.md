I represent data that are sent to a server.

When GTEventPacking object asks for data to send, the data are packed and added to #data:, then there are other general information about the bundle, e.g. computer id. I keep all those information. I can also unpack the data using #unpackedData.

For the simple backward compatibility, all my data are stored in a dictionary.

For the Collaborators Part:  
- GTEventCollector creates instance of me and adds additional information about sent data, see GTEventCollector>>#updateAnnouncement:
- GTEventPacking serialize #data and me in order to send me to a server
