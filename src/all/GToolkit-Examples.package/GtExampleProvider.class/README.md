I am a superclass for classes whose main goal is to provide  examples. I only use the trait TGtExampleAssertable to provide subclasses with assertions that can be used within examples.

Classes providing examples do not have to subclass me. I am only here for convenience. Classes providing examples can use themselves TGtExampleAssertable or they can implement their own assertion methods.
