FAMIXInheritance represents an inheritance relationship between one subtype (e.g. a subclass) and one supertype (e.g. a superclass).

To represent multiple inheritance, multiple instances of FAMIXInheritance should be created. 
FAMIXInheritance puts in relation two types, this way inheritance, for example, between classes and between interfaces can be modelled.
