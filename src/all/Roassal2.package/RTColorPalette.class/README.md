Each ColorPalette is a set of beautiful color schemes in a context for a specific purpose.

Each palette contains several color schemes. Each scheme can be selected in different numbers of colors: 3 or 5 or 11 (depends on each scheme).

We have three palettes:
- Qualitative: helps to distinguish different classes of data. 
- Sequential: useful for showing graduable data with a very light "low color" increasing darkness to "high color".
- Diverging: it contains color scales with diverging colors on the extremes and transition colors from one extreme to the other. 

More detailed information is on it class comments.
