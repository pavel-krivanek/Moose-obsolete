An element is a wrapper to an external provided object (e.g., a number, a file, your object).
To an element, you can add a shape (composed or not), and interaction. Elements are added in a view. 

To be visible, elements must have at least one shape. One key aspect of Roassal is that shapes may accept metrics or numerical values to define their visual dimensions (''e.g.,'' height, width, color, border width). Instead of giving absolute numerical values to define the visual aspect of the graphical element (as with most visualization frameworks), functions used as metrics may be provided.
