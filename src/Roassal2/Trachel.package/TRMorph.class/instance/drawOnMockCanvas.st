drawOnMockCanvas
	"This method is used to trigger all the rendering in a temporary FormCanvas. This method is useful when a bug happens when rendering. Such situation are difficult to debug to the multi-threading and low level graphical primitive. The method #drawOnMockCanvas helps addressing this.

Here is an example:
v := RTView new.
es := RTBox elementsOn: (1 to: 10).
v addAll: es.
RTGridLayout on: es.
v canvas buildMorph drawOnMockCanvas
