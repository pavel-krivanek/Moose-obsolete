An abstract parser that repeatedly parses between 'min' and 'max' instances of its delegate. The default configuration parses an infinite number of elements, as 'min' is set to 0 and 'max' to infinity (SmallInteger maxVal).

Instance Variables:
	min	<Integer>	The minimum number of repetitions.
	max	<Integer>	The maximum number of repetitions.
